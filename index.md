The user will see time off requests from anyone under them in the organizational chain. So if "Sharon" is "Bob's Manager" and "Bob" is "Steve's Manager". Then Sharon will see Bob's requests along with Steve's requests. 

There are toolbar settings on the grid to filter some of this information down though. From the dropdown menu, you can select a few different options:

1. **Any Available Requests**
2. My Requests
3. Any Reporting to Me
4. My Direct Reports
5. My Indirect Reports
6. Organizational Reports.
